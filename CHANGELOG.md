## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cross-agent `PreToolUse` hooks for Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Qoder
- Shared protected-directory policy for destructive `rm` and `rmdir` commands
- `BETTER_RM_PROTECTED_DIRS` support for adding project-specific protected paths
- Hook protocol and policy tests in `test-hooks.js`

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added
- Timestamp and content hash appended to trashed filenames for better tracking and deduplication
- Filename format in trash: `filename__YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_NNNNNNNNN__hash`
- MD5 hash calculation for file content (with SHA256 fallback)
- Directory hash calculation based on all contained files
- Nanosecond-precision timestamps to prevent filename collisions during rapid deletions
- Deletion log file (`.deletion_log`) in TRASH_DIR that records all deletion operations
  - Logs timestamp, original path, trash path, hash, and file type for each deletion
  - Format: `TIMESTAMP | ORIGINAL_PATH | TRASH_PATH | HASH | FILE_TYPE`
- Comprehensive test script (`test-better-rm.sh`) for validating all features
  - 28 test cases covering all functionality
  - Container-compatible for CI/CD integration
  - Detailed test documentation in TEST_README.md

### Changed
- Trashed files now always include timestamp and hash suffix (previously only added on conflicts)
- Improved directory hash calculation with secure handling of special characters

### Security
- Use `find -print0`, `sort -z`, and `xargs -0 -r` to safely handle filenames with special characters
- Prevent filename injection attacks when calculating directory hashes

### Fixed
- Empty directory hash calculation now works correctly
- Special characters in filenames are handled safely during hash calculation

## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-09

- Customizable trash directory via `TRASH_DIR` environment variable
- Colored output for better user experience
- Protection for important directories (system, user home, Git repositories)

### Features
- Move files to `~/.Trash` instead of permanent deletion
- Maintain full path structure in trash for easy recovery
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution (legacy behavior, replaced in 1.1.0)
- Interactive and force modes
